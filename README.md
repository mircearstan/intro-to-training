# Assignment: PyTorch and Intro to Training

## Overview
This assignment introduces you to PyTorch and demonstrates the process of training a simple MNIST classification model. You will compare the performance of different hardware configurations (CPU vs. GPU) while executing the tasks in Google Colaboratory (Colab).

### Objectives
1. Gain familiarity with PyTorch for machine learning and deep learning tasks.
2. Train a simple neural network model to classify the MNIST dataset.
3. Compare performance differences between CPU and GPU execution.

## Part 0: Setting Up
We will use Google Colaboratory (Colab) for this assignment. Colab provides access to Python, GPUs, and TPUs, so you don't need to install anything on your machine. However, the code can also be run locally on Linux (or Windows WSL) with the necessary libraries installed, such as Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, and PyTorch.

## Part 1: Learning Resources
### Introduction to MNIST
MNIST is a dataset widely used in AI as the "Hello world" of machine learning. To learn more, visit the [MNIST Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).

### PyTorch Tutorials
- Text-based tutorial: [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- Video tutorial: [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)

Go over these resources to familiarize yourself with PyTorch.

## Part 3: Submission Instructions
### Steps to Complete
1. Finish all sections of the Colab notebook.
2. Export your notebook as a PDF:
   - Navigate to **File > Print > Adobe PDF** in Colab.
3. Upload the PDF to GitHub Classroom by committing it to your private assignment repository.
